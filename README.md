# Web-ClassManage
A project of flask web about class management
## Run enviroment:
  1. Pycharm+anoconda2<br>
  2. Firefox<br>
  3. Mysql5.7.16<br>
### You must configure the enviroment before run, besides, make sure you have imported the sql script before running.
Simply put, you need to create a database as well as define some basic options.<br>
## The contents in the folder are described as follow:
  1. The files in ClassMag/static include images, CSS and JS which run in the client.<br>
  2. The files in ClassMag/templates are the html pages show in browser.<br>
  3. The python file in ClassMag/ClassMag.py is the main function of the server.<br>
  4. The file called Allproc.sql is the stored procedure in the database used in the web.<br>
  5. The PDF file test.pdf is the test example which I have already completed before and you can use the web according to it.<br>
  6. Generally, you can use firefox to view the page for better effect.<br>
### I use bootstrap as the basic frame of the website for convenient.
